# PulsePal stimulation examples for optogenetics

My list of PulsePal (v2) protocols for photostimulation and open-ephy GUI manipulation. 

## Requirements

PulsePal only works with Python 2.7 at the moment. Use a conda environment with Python 2. 

```bash
conda create --name pulsepal python=2.7
```

Assuming that you do not have it already use my [pulsepal.yml](https://github.com/JoseGuzman/minibrain/blob/master/PulsePal/pulsepal.yml) and type:

```bash
conda env create -f pulsepal.yml
```
